Area to sync RHEL 8 and 9 to /rhel/repositories.

This area is ansible managed.

For each combination of architecture and version there is a separate
sync script in /rhel/bin. The sync scripts are running inside of
Podman because the RPM on the host (CentOS 7) is too old.

The content of /rhel/repositories is only made available to the OBS
server on port 82.
